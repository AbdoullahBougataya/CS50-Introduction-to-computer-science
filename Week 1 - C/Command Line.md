## Linux and the Command Line
---

*   _Linux_ is an operating system that is accessible via the command line in the terminal window in VS Code.
*   Some common command-line arguments we may use include:
    *   `cd`, for changing our current directory (folder)
    *   `cp`, for copying files and directories
    *   `ls`, for listing files in a directory
    *   `mkdir`, for making a directory
    *   `mv`, for moving (renaming) files and directories
    *   `rm`, for removing (deleting) files
    *   `rmdir`, for removing (deleting) directories
*   The most commonly used is `ls` which will list all the files in the current directory or directory. Go ahead and type `ls` into the terminal window and hit `enter`. Youâ€™ll see all the files in the current folder.
*   Another useful command is `mv`, where you can move a file from one file to another. For example, you could use this command to rename `Hello.c` (notice the uppercase `H`) to `hello.c` by typing `mv Hello.c hello.c`.
*   You can also create folders. You can type `mkdir pset1` to create a directory called `pset1`.
*   You can then use `cd pset1` to change your current directory to `pset1`.

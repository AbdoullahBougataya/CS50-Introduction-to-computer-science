## Welcome!
---
- This class is about more than computer programming!
- Indeed, this class is about problem-solving in a way that is exceedingly empowering! You will likely take the problem solving that you learn here will likely be instantly applicable to your work beyond this course and even your career as a whole!
- However, it will not be easy! You will be “drinking from the firehose” of knowledge during this course. You’ll be amazed at what you will be able to accomplish in the coming weeks.
- This course is far more about you advancing “you” from “where you are today” than hitting some imagined standard.
- The most important opening consideration in this course: Give the time you need to learn through this course. Everyone learns differently. If something does not work out well at the start, know that with time you will grow and grow in your skill.
- Don’t be scared if this is your first computer science class! For most of your peers, this is their first computer science class too!

## What’s Ahead
---
- You will be learning this week about [Scratch](Scratch), a visual programming language.
- Then, in future weeks, you will learn about [C](Week%201%20-%20C.md). That will look something like this:
    ``` c
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main(void)
    {
      printf("hello, world\n");
    }
    ```
- Further, as the weeks progress, you will learn about [algorithms](Week%203%20-%20Algorithms.md).
- You will learn about memory.
- You will learn about buggy code and what causes computer crashes.
- You will learn about data structures such as a hash table.
- Then, we will transition to a new, higher-level language called _Python_. Your code will look something like this:
    ``` python
    print("hello, world")
    ```
- This class will give you a strong understanding of how recent programming languages developed from the earlier ones.
- You will learn SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- We will also be looking at how we can use databases and third-party frameworks to build web applications.
